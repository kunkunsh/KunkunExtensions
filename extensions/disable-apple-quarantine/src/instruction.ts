# Disable Apple Quarantine

Mac Apps made by developers not paying Apple's $99/year developer fee are marked as "damaged" by Apple. This is because they are not signed by an Apple Developer ID.

This extension allows you to disable Apple Quarantine on these apps.

There are 3 ways:

1. Drag and Drop damanged .app files here
2. Copy the .app file, this extension will automatically detect the copied file
3. Select the .app file in Finder, this extension will automatically detect the selected file

Method 2 and 3 require you to copy or select the file before entering this extension.
